A series of experiments and arguments 
proves to every man that he, as an object of 
observation, is subject to certain laws, and man 
submits to them and never resists the laws of 
gravity or impermeability once he has become 
acquainted with them. But the same series of 
experiments and arguments proves to him that 
the complete freedom of which he is conscious 
in himself is impossible, and that his every 
action depends on his organization, his  
character, and the motives acting upon him; yet 
man never submits to the deductions of these 
experiments and arguments. Having learned 
from experiment and argument that a stone 
falls downwards, a man indubitably believes 
this and always expects the law that he has 
learned to be fulfilled. 

But learning just as certainly that his will 
is subject to laws, he does not and cannot believe
this.
